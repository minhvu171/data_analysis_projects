# data\_analysis\_projects

The folder bioinformatics\_project contains six subfolders, each corresponding to a distinct type of visualization developed for this project. These figures serve different analytical purposes but generally aim to visualize gene activity or sample-level patterns within datasets sourced from Excel input files. Where applicable, each subfolder includes the input data, the resulting figures, and the script used to generate them. As the project focuses on gene expression data analysis, some portions of the code may be more challenging to interpret for readers without a biology background; however, the structure and outputs should still provide a clear overview of the tasks performed.



The file "Simple\_Machine\_Learning\_cases" includes four tasks completed as part of the course Data Intensive Programming, which emphasizes large-scale data management and analysis using programming tools. The exercises are based on a large, six-month time-series dataset, with minute-level measurements recorded in each row. The columns represent timestamps and multiple measurement types, such as temperature, humidity, and solar power production (see scripts for details). Each task involves building a simple machine learning model to predict sample labels using different feature sets.
